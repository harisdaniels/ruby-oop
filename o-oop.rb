# Class Information
# If class definitions are executable code, 
# this implies that they execute in the context of some object: self must reference something.

class Box
    # print v
    puts "Type of self = #{self.type}"
    puts "Name of self = #{self.name}"
end

# Type of self = Class
# Name of self = Box
